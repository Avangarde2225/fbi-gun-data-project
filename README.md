Project: Investigating FBI Gun Checks dataset
Table of Contents
My goal is to explore the trends of U.S gun purchases and its relationship with census variables and transformed, combined and visualized gun and census datasets using NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.Gun data and census data are two separate datasets. Their common variables/values include state of United States and year month, which requires data cleaning at first. I used joins to merge these two datasets to see the relationship between gun purchase and census variable.

Introduction
In this project I will be using the data provided by this github and the original source of data is coming from FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). I guess one of the most significant caveats to this data is that state gun laws differ from each other. So some states have stricter gun laws other may not have.
